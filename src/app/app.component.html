<!-- The title is within two curly braces which signifies
Angulars interpolation binding syntax. 

To display h2 that belongs to the foodtruck component,
we must add it to the template of the shell AppComponent.
Recall that app-foodtruck is the element selector for the
foodtruck component, so we add an app foodtruck element to 
the AppComponent template file. -->
<h1>{{title}}</h1>
<app-foodtruck></app-foodtruck>
